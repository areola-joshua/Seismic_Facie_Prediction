🧭 Subsurface Interpretation: Enhances subsurface geological studies and interpretation.
🔍 Data-Driven: Utilizes computational methods for accurate facies prediction.
🛠️ Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python 🐍
Machine Learning: scikit-learn (SVM) 🧠
Data Handling: pandas, numpy
Visualization: matplotlib 🎨
📦 Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
bash
Copy 
`git clone https://github.com/Areola-Joshua/facies-mapping-svm.git`  
cd `facies-mapping-svm`  
Install the required libraries:
bash
Copy 
`pip install scikit-learn numpy pandas matplotlib`

🚀 Usage
Prepare your geological dataset in .csv format and place it in the data directory.
Train the SVM model:
bash
Copy 
`python train_svm_model.py`

Predict facies for new data:
bash
Copy 
`python predict_facies.py`  
Visualize the facies classification results:
bash
Copy 
`python visualize_facies_results.py`

📊 Results
The model achieved XX% accuracy in mapping geological facies based on input features.
Results were visualized and interpreted for better subsurface analysis.
